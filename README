This project originates in the course IERG5270, 
'Advanced Topics in P2P Networks'. 

>> Motivation 

Multilayer P2P Video Systems have drawn some research interest
recently. This project aims at surveying related literature
and providing a case study of one simulation platform. 
Since Multi-Layer Codec is not the only choice of underlying 
codec and P2P is not the only choice for networking design, 
the author extends the topic to Adaptive Video Streaming. 

>> Reading Suggestion

The presentation slides and case study part of the paper 
may contain some foreign languages, for they are based on 
the ASTRI simulation platform. This platform is restricted
to ASTRI related research use only. So I can not provide 
the code here. If you're really interested the platform, 
You'd better contact ASTRI directly. 

The section 'Problem Scope' digests several papers in related 
area. This may not be very well written due to lack of 
experience and time to study them thoroughly. Nevertheless, 
those works mentioned this paper can serve as a good starting
point if you have interest in this topic. This is also the 
motivation that I make this course project public. I'm afraid
I'll never touch those stuffs after this project. There are 
always something you won't do in the future if you do not do 
it now. I write up this paper to facilitate others' potential 
research.

\title{Adaptive Video Streaming: 
 \\a Survey and Case Study}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
	In the past decade, Internet traffic has seen a significant 
	change from web browsing to video viewing. The ongoing trend 
	raises a chanllenging problem: how to stream data to heterogeous 
	peers? 
	
	The designer of such data streaming architecture should 
	bear the following considerations in mind: QoE, server load, 
	network resource efficiency, scalability, etc. The heterogeneous 
	peer network condition makes the design more complicated. The 
	underlying codec ranges from Multi Description Coding to Multi 
	Layer Coding. The data deliver architecture ranges from unicast,
	 multicast, to P2P network. Researchers have focused on different 
	 system settings and optimization objectives. 
	 
	 This paper will first
	  sum up several works in the context of adaptive video streaming. 
	  At the same time, we do a case study on a commercial adaptive 
	  video streaming system, which combines Multilayer Codec and P2P 
	  technology. Possible improvements on this system are proposed
	   with reasoning. Some of the conjectures are
	   verified through a corresponding simulation platform based on NS2.
